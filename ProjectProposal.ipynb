We expect to see that older Bitcoin users will have a higher rate of transactions than newer users, and that transaction rate for users will be increasing over time."

    "Cryptocurrency was majorly introduced and acknowledged only recently in the 21st century. It is a concept that continues to remain a mystery for most people, and yet is steadily gaining popularity and increasing usership, especially among major financial institutions such as banks, governments, and large tech companies. In fact, nearly all major financial firms and prominent software companies have by now performed substantial research on various types of cryptocurrency. This suggests a question of whether cryptocurrency will soon become the foundation of the world’s economy, or in the very least be a widely used form of currency among people in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Forbes, a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin will gradually rise in popularity and will become a widespread form of commonly used currency because of its reliability, in that it can’t be bounced or charged back, and works 24/7, 365 days a year. It is easily accessible during emergencies, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, while a bank could be shut down. Researchers at MIT have performed extensive analysis of the same datasets we will be using, coming to the conclusion that powerful Bitcoin users form advanced financial networks to significantly expand their wealth. This information would suggest that users would be increasing their activity using Bitcoin, and therefore lead to the logical hypothesis that older users are steadily becoming more active using the Bitcoin platform. \n",

    "Data Cleaning:\n",
    "Bitcoin uses a change based system where a user breaks up whole Bitcoins into pieces in order to spend them. When it comes time to spend Bitcoins the wallet software will round up as much change as it can and send it to the recipient. Our datasets show the change being sent. This clutters the data and is unnecessary for our analysis. We will clean the data by consolidating the change into a single value. As the dataset is much too large to process and analyze, we will analyze only a certain number of Bitcoin addresses by doing the following steps: set a certain number of  groups, each of which corresponds to a time interval; divide the Bitcoin addresses in the dataset into the groups according to the timestamp of the first transaction; randomly draw a certain number of samples from each group. Then we gather all the transaction information in the dataset for all the sample we draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis:\n",
    "We must check the distributions of amount of Bitcoin, and the quantity of transactions for every address in the sample. We can do this with pandas. This step will give us clues as to how users activity is distributed. We can then plot the age of account against number of transactions and the account balance. With the data we can perform a linear regression, and plot the line of best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to report:\n",

    "The dataset contains every single Bitcoin transaction, beginning with the release of Bitcoin to the public and up to approximately February 9, 2008. This eliminates the possibility of bias within the data collection method, as the dataset contains all of the existing information. As we will only be using a subset of this large dataset, we will be using random selection of users to ensure that our subset is a valid representation of the original dataset. This being said, this dataset obviously only contains information on Bitcoin user transaction. While the results of this analysis could provide insight into trends in the tech community, it may not be generalizable to the entire US or world population, as the majority of Bitcoin users are likely highly educated in the world of technology or finance. \n",
